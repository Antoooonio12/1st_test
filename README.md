## About me
Hi everyone, IÂ´m new to Github!
My name is Antoonio and I'm a young student that loves coding and tech. 

## Important info
_This is **only** an initial test in order to try out how Github works._
To run this test, you need to have Python installed in your PC. You can download it from its official web: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Soon
Please, consider reviewing my **new repo** based on Arduino projects: https://github.com/Antoooonio12/arduino_projects

## Contact
If you want to contact me, please use my email: contact.antooonio12@gmail.com. There you can suggest me anything you want.
My goal is to learn a lot, so I'll apreciate it.
